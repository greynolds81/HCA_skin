# HCA Skin single cell analysis

This repository contains code used for the analysis of the HCA Skin samples. Fletcher, Vegh, Reynolds et al. (2019)

All analyses had files in R dir sourced. Please see `sessioninfo.txt` for the version of R packages used.

Commands in `cluster.sh` were run from the `pipelines` directory of the single cell analysis bundle (https://github.com/haniffalab/scRNA-seq_analysis) set up on a high-performance computing cluster of the Computer Science department of Newcastle University, running SGE task manager.
