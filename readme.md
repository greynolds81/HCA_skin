# HCA Skin single cell analysis

This repository contains code used for the analysis of the HCA Skin samples.

All files in the R directory were sourced. Please see `sessioninfo.txt` for the version of R packages used.

The web portal files were made using the single cell analysis bundle (https://github.com/haniffalab/scRNA-seq_analysis), set up on a high-performance computing cluster of the School of Computing, Newcastle University.
